# Addiction

America is in the midst of a heroin epidemic.

Opiod addiction leads to heroin use and heroin addiction, and heroin-related deaths
have quadrupled between 2002 and 2013. Simultaneously,
the notion of the "Attention Economy" has driven top businesses,
particularly those fueled by advertising, to create addictive experiences.

Some, like neuroscience researcher Marc Lewis,
[believe that addiction is significantly more multifaceted](http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/30/marc-lewis-the-neuroscientist-who-believes-addiction-is-not-a-disease)
than the prevailing baseline model would have us believe.

This other way of thinking holds that addiction
is powerfully affected by environment and cognition.

This could be dismissed as maverick ideation or crackpot theorizing
if it wasn't in harmony with [an extensive study](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/02/144431794/what-vietnam-taught-us-about-breaking-bad-habits) [conducted on
heroin-addicted vietnam veterans almost thirty years ago](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1521-0391.2010.00046.x/abstract).
So what is it about addiction that we're missing, at large,
that some, including the addicted, have figured out?

And what can it teach us about how we engage with a world that
increasingly asks for our attention?

And how do we go about becoming addicted to things that are good for us?

Drug overdoses claim more lives ([1](https://guinta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-guinta-and-kuster-lead-bipartisan-task-force-combat-heroin-epidemic), [2](https://guinta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-kuster-and-guinta-introduce-stop-abuse-act-address-heroin-epidemic)) in New Hampshire than any other preventable cause. A week before I started writing this, seventy-five people overdosed in heroin in Chicago over a weekend.
Actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman died in 2014 in NYC from an overdose of heroin. Three times as many people die in New Jersey from heroin overdoses than any other state.

In a world where drug use could be dialed back by e.g. stricter law enforcement,
punishment, and [drug prevention programs](http://priceonomics.com/dare-the-anti-drug-program-that-never-actually/), the War On Drugs would have been a success.
Instead, as as these initiatives are retired or scaled-back and deconstructed,
we find out about the damage that is done to people for little or no overall gain
and we are forced to rethink policy.

As the response to drug addiction has been met with these weak attempts
at curbing the side-effects of drug-fueled behavior and the ills of addiction,
attempts at introducing stimuli that replicate the behavioral patterns of addiction
have manifest across a number of consumer industries to really strong economic response.
