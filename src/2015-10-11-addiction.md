  # Addiction

  ---

  ## America is being ravaged by heroin and heroin-like prescription drugs that affect us through the mechanism of addiction.  Simultaneously, the notion of the "Attention Economy" has driven businesses to create addictive experiences.

  Addiction is incredibly complex. It's like a horse of physiological
  mechanisms tied to a cart full of memories and personality traits that
  chain themselves together to produce psychological triggers.


  Neuroscience researcher Marc Lewis argues that this complex relationship
  makes addiction less a disease than a behavioral problem where addiction
  is powerfully affected by environment and cognition.[^1] In fact, he says,
  _Addiction shouldn't be considered a disease at all_.

  This could be dismissed as maverick ideation or crackpot theorizing
  if it wasn't in harmony with an extensive study conducted on
  heroin-addicted vietnam veterans almost thirty years ago.
  The study followed heroin-addicted vietnam veterans and concluded that
  they were 80% less likely to be addicted to heroin after returning
  to America. The explanation was that the environmental factors that
  the addicted veterans associated with heroin abuse were absent.[^2] [^3]

  So what is it about addiction that we're missing, that some,
  like the ex-addicted and some really-successful-businesses,
  seem to have figured out?

  And what can it teach us about how we engage with a world that
  increasingly asks for our attention?

  And how do we go about becoming addicted to things that are good for us?

  ## Opioids

  Drug overdoses claim more lives in New Hampshire than any other preventable cause.[^4]
  A week before I started writing this, seventy-five people overdosed in heroin in Chicago
  over a weekend.
  Actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman died in 2014 in NYC from an overdose of heroin.
  Three times as many people die in New Jersey from heroin overdoses than any other state.

  In a world where drug use could be dialed back by e.g. stricter law enforcement,
  harsher punishments, and value-defining drug prevention programs,
  the War On Drugs would have been a success. But that didn't happen.

  The high-profile, nationwide D.A.R.E. program was tremendously popular and
  simultaneously a tremendous failure.[^5]
  The vast majority of prison inmates are non-violent offenders. A significant portion
  of these prisoners were sentenced on drug offenses.
  As past attempts to curb society's drug problems fail to produce results and are
  deconstructed and reflected upon, we find out about the human costs
  and we rethink our policies.

  Opiod addiction leads to heroin use and heroin addiction, and heroin-related deaths
  quadrupled between 2002 and 2013. 120 Americans die every day from drug overdoses, more than from car crashes.[^6]

  Facebook's primary source of revenue is advertising.
  Google's primary source of revenue is advertising.
  Instagram's primary source of revenue is advertising.
  Twitter's primary source of revenue is advertising.
  Television's primary source of revenue is advertising.

  Advertising isn't the only business model in the world, but it is incredibly
  common in many of the realms we engage with on a regular and repeated basis.
  And the best way to justify the highest number of dollars from advertisers
  is by creating experiences that demand and engage the advertisee's attention.
  Establishing and preserving an addictive environment is a great way of
  keeping attention.

## Deceiving The Monkey, Or, Conditioning-Hacking

Humans are complex, yet stupid. Our higher-order functions are deeply nuanced,
built on top of machinery of flesh and neural networks.
We construct vast ontologies expressed through linguistic symbols mapped to
human expressions, human-made objects, and human-centric notions.
We layer law and social systems on top of this basework.
We use these structures &mdash; structures like law &mdash;
to defend or curb aspects of our lower-order selves.

I think the lower-order self, the part of us which is closest to our animal nature,
is the self that is most "human" &mdash; at least in the ways that we tend to
define ourselves these days. Humanity is a species that is deeply emotional
in spite of great boasts about our achievements in knowledge, strategy, engineering, etc.
Our core "humanness" - these animal parts - cause us to respond unfailingly to the same
classical and operant conditioning mechanisms that early-to-mid 20th century psychology
pioneers like B.F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov explored.

The modern environment (anthropocene, quantified, processed, surveilled) leaves us
open to being exposed-to and placed-under conditioning by the data processors
who only see us as market participants. This is good behavior when the market
and the entities participating in the market are the first-class citizens,
but it all-too-often reduces the human forces involved in the consumer activity
to second-class citizens. This is toxic. Illuminatingly, the traits that make us
susceptible to this conditioning can be re-tooled to free us from this conditioning.

## Rerouting The Bullseye


Take your ability to reflect and use it to subvert your behavior.
Use classical conditioning against itself. Classical is mostly your environment.
To the best of your ability[^7], change your environment if it doesn't suit the behavior you want.
Use operant conditioning against itself. Find something greater, psychologically,
than the consequence that feeds the behavior. Find consequences that you like
(e.g. outcomes that you aspire to) and use them to drive your behaviors. You might just become a better person.
