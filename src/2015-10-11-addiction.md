# Addiction

With heroin usage back on the rise in some places and the way
the mere existence of the the notion of an "attention economy" drives
businesses around the world to create addictive content,
addiction becomes an interesting topic to explore.

Some, like neuroscience researcher Marc Lewis,
[believe that addiction is significantly more multifaceted](http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/30/marc-lewis-the-neuroscientist-who-believes-addiction-is-not-a-disease)
than the prevailing baseline model would have us believe.

This other way of thinking holds that addiction is powerfully affected by environment and cognition.

This could be dismissed as maverick or crackpot research
if it wasn't in harmony with [an extensive study](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/02/144431794/what-vietnam-taught-us-about-breaking-bad-habits) [conducted on
heroin-addicted vietnam veterans almost thirty years ago](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1521-0391.2010.00046.x/abstract).
So what is it about addiction that we're missing, at large,
that some, including the addicted, have figured out?

And what can it teach us about how we engage with a world that
increasingly asks for our attention?

More productively, what can it teach us about _how_ to engage with that world?

And then, how do we go about becoming addicted to things that are good for us?

New Hampshire and many other states in the northeast are in the midst of a heroin epidemic.
Drug overdoses claim more lives ([1](https://guinta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-guinta-and-kuster-lead-bipartisan-task-force-combat-heroin-epidemic), [2](https://guinta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-kuster-and-guinta-introduce-stop-abuse-act-address-heroin-epidemic)) in New Hampshire than any other preventable cause.
Phillip Seymour Hoffman died in 2014 in NYC from an overdose of heroin.

In a world where drug use could be dialed back by e.g. stricter law enforcement,
punishment, and [drug prevention programs](http://priceonomics.com/dare-the-anti-drug-program-that-never-actually/), the War On Drugs would have been
a success. Instead, as we find out more about what differentiates effective policy
from that which damages people for little or no net gain,
these initiatives are dissected and the damage is measured.

Simultaneously, as the response to drug addiction has been met with fairly abortive attempts
at curbing the side-effects of drug-fueled behavior and the ills of addiction,
attempts at introducing stimuli that replicate the behavioral patterns of addiction manifest
across a number of consumer industries.
