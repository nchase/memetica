# Grids

> "How do you make websites that looks like they're designed on grids without actually being designed on grids?"

It's simple really: just be really careful with how you write your CSS,
and actually, try not to write much CSS at all.

Eventually you'll forget to be careful and some mess will get out there.
But if you've been careful otherwise up until that point then:

- There won't be much mess
- The mess will be relatively small
- The mess will be easy to see because it won't be surrounded by {other mess}

And that's it.

Yes, it can be challenging.

Only you can decide whether or not it's worth it.

## 'Simple' as compared to 'Easy'

This process is very _simple_. Practicing this behavior truly
drives _simplicity_, but it's not _easy_.[^1] Not at first anyway.

There's a subtle, but incredibly important distinction between 'easy' and 'simple'.
In writing less, one way you keep it simple is by reducing surface area.
To write as little as possible without sacrificing meaning,
you'll need to develop expertise as informed by
[CSS Specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/).

Reading specifications is a huge challenge but it's necessary to make this work.
You don't have to read every spec that exists &mdash; not even close &mdash; but do start with
[CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/)
(a wonderful foundation for understanding how presentation works on the web)
and the fairly-recent
[Flexbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/).

The more you learn about these things (and use them in practice),
the more you unlock your ability to write simple code that makes sense.

And the more you can do that, the better you are at building the web.
Isn't that why you're reading this?

[^1]: Rich Hickey has
[an excellent hour-long talk on the subtle difference between these two terms](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).
He illuminates the difference through describing software engineering problems created by
striving for ease over simplicity. The core principals apply really well to CSS,  which I
imagine causes huge problems for people who insist that CSS isn't a "Real Language."
