# Font Optimization Through Subsetting

Web fonts have come a long way in the last few years. There are as many great
options as there are creative people in the world. Many decent options are free
or available for a reasonable fee.

We can use fonts and font combinations as tools of expression and creativity.
We can impress certain _feelings_ upon our users through expert font usage,
which can lead to powerful, satisfying ends for all participants.

But fonts can also make the web slow. In the interest of a fast web,
how can we make fonts faster?

Recently I found a font that I really liked and I started using it on one of my sites.[^1]
As usual, I found myself doing some light performance profiling of the page
some time thereafter.

I was horrified to discover that the font weighed in at a whopping `1.1MB`,
roughly 10x the size of the entirety of the rest of the content and assets,
literally everything else coming down through the pipe.

I thought this would be a great time to investigate _why_ the font was so large
and I hoped it would give me an opportunity to try an optimization
I was curious about.

## Subsetting Case Study: 66% Improvement

The optimization I was interested in was _Font Subsetting_.
This is just the process of taking each _glyph_ (or character) in the font
and removing the ones you don't need.

The font contained 421 glyphs and I was pretty sure I didn't need them all.

I loaded the font into [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io)[^2] and thought
about my use case: I was only going to be using the font to write
title-sized/display content in English, with the additional potential for
very basic English punctuation. Knowing this, I got rid of everything that wasn't
an English-language alphanumeric or basic English punctuation.

When I re-generated the font, I was down to 96 glyphs and the new file size
was roughly 33% of the original filesize.

`330KB` for a font isn't even close to excellent &mdash; pages should be
much smaller &mdash; but it's an example of the kind of improvement you
can see from font subsetting. If you can identify the use cases for your font,
there's a good chance that you'll be able to remove a lot of the glyphs
that you just won't need.

## How can we do font subsetting?

[FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io) is a free/open source that will let you edit
fonts and output changes to a wide variety of formats. This is what I used
for my investigation.

[FF Subsetter](http://www.subsetter.com/) is an online tool
that claims to automatically optimize fonts. I didn't have any luck with it,
but I only tried one font.

Font Squirrel has a
[webfont generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
that does some optimization. The output that it gave me was
significantly smaller &mdash; `660KB` &mdash; a decent optimization,
but not even close to what I was able to get.
There are a lot of optional tweaks here that might  deliver better performance.


Google Fonts will let you selectively choose _which_ characters to render.
You can read more about that feature
[here](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started?hl=en#Optimizing_Requests)
under the 'Optimizing Requests' heading.


Lastly, there's the Glyphs app, which is a very sophisticated font
creating and editing tool, but unlike the other options here it isn't free.

      font style.
[^2]: I had serious trouble getting FontForge installed on Mac OS 10.11.
      I tried installing the app as described on the FontForge webpage linked above
      and I also tried via a couple of Homebrew formulas.
      There are a handful of recent issues on GitHub
      ([like this one](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/2542))
      where people are talking about the problem and how to solve it.
      Ultimately what worked for me was using the `.dmg` referred to in
      [this issue](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/2530#issuecomment-148997584).
