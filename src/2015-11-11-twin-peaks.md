  # Twin Peaks

  ## A Great Deal of Pain, A Fair Amount of Blood.

  I started Twin Peaks in December 2012. I watched it in deep concentrated
  stretches up through January, then got exhausted near the end of the second
  season, took a break for many months, and finally finished  in mid-June 2013.
  I started the movie shortly thereafter, and left off somewhere in the middle
  due to technical difficulties. All in all, it took nearly a year for me to
  finish the show. I'm really glad that I did.

  Twin Peaks featured arcanum and horror alongside typical soap opera plotlines,
  a detective story augmented by events touched-by-or-taking-place-on the astral plane,
  a quaint and sincere weird sense of humor that probably felt
  as peculiar on prime time television in 1990 as it does now in 2012,
  and a backward talking midget (who completely crushes it).
  The sets (with rare but important exceptions) and costumes are completely normal for the era.
  The whole thing feels like it was extracted from a time capsule containing
  everything else from the very-early-90s. Really, it feels like
  a hyper-involved episode of _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_ for adults
  spread out over two seasons and nearly 25 hours or even _Northern Exposure_
  passed through a _Silent Hill_ filter.

  The show changes quite a bit in the second season, and these changes
  were maligned by critics. But with history having laid down some context
  describing the real-life drama surrounding the production of this second
  season, even these maligned episodes become interesting in their own right.

  The movie, _Fire Walk With Me_, is an excellent return to form.
  It explores the supernatural multi-dimensionality of Twin Peaks and the region
  surrounding it. It brings the show's original plot to a satisfying resolution.

  The movie feels oddly foreign when contrasted with the television series.
  According to an excellent article that was published as a retrospective
  in honor of the film's twentieth anniversary[^1]. It did well in Japan,
  but it failed everywhere else. The lighting in the movie is moodier
  and the intensity is ratcheted up while some of the tropes of 1990s era
  television drama and soap opera are peeled away.

  The fact that the movie takes place before the events of the television series
  magnifies the strangeness. Like some of Lynch's best work, the plot and pace change
  significantly at some point in the film, and eventually the careful
  management of this new plot and any remaining vestiges of the original
  collapse into an exercise in film direction through attempting to deliver
  felt-presence-of-direct-experience to the audience.
  This trick has yet to get old for me, because David Lynch is great at it.

  If we remove all of the kitschy, shitty parts of Twin Peaks _the show_
  and combine it with Fire Walk With Me _the movie_, we're left with something
  powerful that casts a long shadow on early entries in the _Silent Hill_
  series in the  _Survival Horror_ video game genre - all are stunningly-realized
  depictions of complete nightmare scenarios.

  In Twin Peaks, these terror-bound properties cross the television-film divide with a
  high level of grace and consistency. But in stripping the 'junk food'
  segments out of the show we lose a lot of its personality and emotion.
  In trope reduction, Twin Peaks is made timeless and more accessible, but it
  also becomes stark and, frankly, more boring.  It becomes excellent
  reference material but it ceases to be television.

  If we combine the TV/film _Twin Peaks_ and leave all of the content intact,
  however, we end up with a fascinating composite work that demonstrates
  a key feature of most things that David Lynch gets credit for.
  It's weird, it's scary, it's fun, it's _in-place_, and it reaches into itself
  to perform Lynch's plot mutation trick, identified above.

  Here are some places where you can find the trick:

  1. Midway through _Fire Walk With Me_,
  2. the show, when the plot starts to go awry,
  3. the point in the plot's trajectory that connects the film and the show.

The actor that played BOB died of HIV-related complications in 1995,
three years after the release of _Fire Walk With Me_. His role on Twin Peaks
was not planned. In fact, the character was conceived completely off-the-cuff;
the idea for the role was prompted by a fortunate mistake[^2].

Happenstance as it may have been, BOB is an unforgettable and iconic chacter.
The role may have been the high point of the actor's professional life.

Coming in three years after the movie, this death, though sad, cannot possibly
be considered significant, eerie, or 'oddly coincidental', no - but it is near
enough to true significance to serve as a metaphor for what the end of the
series represents to me.
