# Distilling "Systemantics"

> _"Our point, repeatedly stressed in this text, is that Systems operate
  according to Laws of Nature, and that Laws of Nature are not suspended
  to accommodate our human shortcomings."_

Systemantics (a.k.a. _The Systems Bible_) was a fun read. Way more accessible
than I expected, highly recommended. A bit distressing in its pessimism[^1], but
engaging and (so far) perennially relevant.

First I'll devote some space to describing some of the features of the text,
then I thought I'd take some cuts from the book that stood out to me and distill
them here for the reader.

But before you read any of this, you should read the
[Wikipedia Page on Systemantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics)
because it does a way better job of distilling this text than I ever could.

## Great Features of _Systemantics_

In No Particular Order:

1. **Axioms.** The book has a tremendous number of hilarious and damning
   axioms, e.g., _"SYSTEMS IN GENERAL WORK POORLY OR NOT AT ALL."_ or
   _"IF YOUR PROBLEM SEEMS UNSOLVABLE, CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY HAVE A
   META-PROBLEM._

2. **Animal Exemplars.** The book has an entire appendix filled with animals
   that illustrate topics the author is trying to illuminate over the course
   of the book, e.g. _The Self-actuating Laboratory Rat_, which serves
   discussion around system-probing as a method of understanding and,
   potentially, though perhaps counter-intuitively, a damage mitigation
   strategy. In the example, researchers discover that laboratory rats,
   previously assumed to be operating under a trial-and-error model at best
   (coupled with a dangerous, unexplainable quickening of risky behavior),
   actually quicken their interaction with objects that give shocks _so that
   they can better understand the operating characterstics of the system that
   they are in._
3. **Neatly Divided.** The book starts with theory and some description of the
   problem space, then switches gears and introduces some practical strategies
   and defense mechanisms applied to a variety of real-world scenarios.
4. **All Of The Appendices.** The book has seven appendices, followed by
   extensive endnotes.

## The Taboo of Failure

The book argues critically that failure has an almost indefatigably strong
negative connotation, so strong that, in fact, most people pretend failure
doesn't exist[^3]. This is wrong in the eyes of the author (and myself)
because failure is an incredibly strong form of _feedback_ in the system
&mdash; perhaps evidence that the model is wrong, or maybe that the model is
missing data &mdash; important components to the system that are not being
properly accounted for.

Like Charles Darwin urged that observers of the world cherish exceptions to the
received truths and understandings of the world in order to advance our
understanding of the world, the author proposes that we cherish failure
in order to come to an understanding of our systems.[^4]

## Le Chatelier's Principle, Human Intransigeance, and The Universe

Le Chatelier's Principle[^5] shows that systems in chemistry very clearly
work to re-adjust themselves toward balance and equilibrium given changes
in any of either concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure.
The suggestion in _Systemantics_ is that any reasonably complex
(e.g. not-just-scalar) systems actively resist disruptive changes,
and that Le Chetalier's Principle is a feature of systems in the universe.

_Human Intransigeance[^6]_ is a defining feature of the human species. The author
holds that our stubborness is simply incompatible with the real systems that we
interact with. This might be true, but personally, I don't think it is. I think
humans, at either far end of a normal distribution, are pretty excellent at,
if not breaking out of systems entirely, then finding the limits of those systems
so that we can understand them better.

> _"THE UNIVERSE IS NOT LIKE A MACHINE except in certain trivial ways.
> Rather: THE UNIVERSE IS LIKE A VERY LARGE SYSTEM."_

Given an ability to find systems that exist in the ungraspably-vast universe-system,
as humans, we have the ability to build our own systems
that complement the ones that were already in place when we got here.

And maybe that's our _mission_[^7]: either as a species trying to survive our
own failings to understand and protect the environment that we were given,
or as a species struck with wonder and curiosity, prodded by the double-edged
sword of enterprise to get feedback that we've done something proveably useful
(or at least, impactful). Or maybe both.


[^1]: Some of the pessimism is dolloped on a little heavier than it needs to be
      for the sake of humor, highly necessary given the severity of the topic.
[^2]: The axioms are, um, plentiful. The book is rife with axioms and concise
      assertions of truth.
[^3]: Reference phrases in the common-collective glossary such as "Failure is
      not an option". In the context of the 'systems' discussion, this fact
      itself is interesting - evidence, perhaps, that our rejection of failure
      as a notion integrable into a productive life, is itself a feature of one
      or more of our systems.
[^4]: And as a systems-thinker, I think this creates a lot of runway for
      understanding _everything_.
[^5]: [Le Chatelier's Principle, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle)
[^6]: 'Intransigeance' is basically stubbornness.
[^7]: Or, at least, it should be.
