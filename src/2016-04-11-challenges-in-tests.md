# Challenges In UI Testing

On the web, we see a combination of multiple separate, independent systems,
needed to produce meaningful artifacts for non-technical users.
At the UI level, these are HTTP, HTML, CSS and JS. Three of these systems are
stateless and each of the four is, in theory, independent of the others.

The _combined artifact_ that these things work in concert to produce is often
challenging to test. We know that it's fruitful to test some of these systems
apart from others. I posit that it's useful to break down some of that and test
UI away from everything else and include design and QA in the conversation.


On the web, at the UI level, we have a combination of multiple because UI is a combination of multiple separate systems (HTML, CSS, JS).
Each of those systems is testable by itself, but the combined artifact
is often difficult or challenging to test.
