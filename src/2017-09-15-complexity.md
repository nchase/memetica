# _Out of the Tar Pit_ and Complexity

Here's a quote that I just love from a paper called "Out of the Tar Pit"

> It is hard to overstate the dangers of complexity. If it is not controlled it
> spreads. The only way to escape this risk is to place the goals of avoid and
> separate at the top of the design objectives for a system. It is not su cient
> simply to pay heed to these two objectives — it is crucial that they be the
> overriding consideration. This is because complexity breeds complexity and
> one or two early “compromises” can spell complexity disaster in the long run.
