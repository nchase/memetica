# `xargs` is great.

## But why?

You should care about `xargs` if you believe what I write about command line
tools in general, because `xargs` turns all of those tools into n-dimensional
swiss army knives.

Briefly: `xargs` takes a command that you want to run as its argument and reads
the inputs (arguments) to that command from
[`STDIN`](https://memetica.ahfr.org/2016-10-24-love-for-pipes-streams.md.html).

It's remarkably powerful when combined with any other tool that writes in a
predictable way to stdout.

Here are some invocations that I like:

* The find-and-replace that you'd do in your editor, but on the command-line
  (and naturally, with the same flexibility): `git grep --ignore-case
  --files-with-matches searchterm | xargs -L 1 sed -i ''
  's/searchTerm/replacementTerm/g'`
