# `xargs` is great.

## But why?

You should care about `xargs` if you believe what I write about command line
tools in general, because `xargs` turns all of those tools into n-dimensional
swiss army knives.

---

Briefly: `xargs` takes a command that you want to run as its argument and reads
the inputs (arguments) to that command from
[`STDIN`](https://memetica.ahfr.org/2016-10-24-love-for-pipes-streams.md.html).

It's remarkably powerful when combined with any other tool that writes in a
predictable way to stdout.

Here are some invocations that I like:

* The find-and-replace that you'd do in your editor, but on the command-line
  (and naturally, with the same flexibility): `git grep --ignore-case
  --files-with-matches searchterm | xargs -L 1 sed -i ''
  's/searchTerm/replacementTerm/g'`[^1]
* Find lines of code for files in a directory and sort files by lines: `find .
  | xargs wc -l | sort -nr` (combine with `awk` to get sum of lines of code)
* This one is really great: simply use `xargs -p` to verify the command before
  each invocation. (It's often nice to see what you're doing before you've done
  it, especially if the operation could be risky).
* Rename all of your `.js` files to `.ts` files, with a prompt for sanity
  checking: `find . -iname '*.js' | grep -E -i --invert-match
  'node_modules|bundle' | xargs -L 1 rename 's/\.js$/\.ts/'`


[^1]: The `-L 1` argument to `xargs` means "run this command once per line."
Without this, commands are executed once per separator (e.g. space or line) found
in the input.
