# What kind of product do you want to be?

Do you want to be the best also-ran, or do you want to be best-in-class? The
effort and energy are very different for each category. Best-in-class isn't

a much more fulfilling life than "mediocre and just kind of in the pack."

There's no science to any of these outcomes. But there are guidelines!
