# Apps that I use

I use lots of apps. Here are a few that I have open often and that come to
mind.

If you want to know more about how I work email me or check out my dotfiles
directory at [github.com/nchase/dotfiles](https://github.com/nchase/dotfiles).

## Vim

Recent plugins that I've found to be useful for vim include [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)
and [TabNine](https://tabnine.com). (TabNine is great whatever editor you're using)

## tmux

I use it with the leader mapped to `^-a` instead of `^-b`, a holdover from my
`screen` days.

Recently I discovered [tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect)
which has made tmux even better.

## Kap.app

[Kap.app](https://getkap.co) is a useful screencap app. It makes it easy to
record UI/UX for discussion (e.g. in pull requests). ffmpeg and libav used to
be my tools of choice for these sorts of tasks, but right now Kap is a good
fit.

## React Native Debugger

Keeps me from muddling my debugging experience with tabs in Chrome (this makes
more sense to me than having a single tab in Chrome that hooked up to a
client-side debugger in Simulator.app alongside many tabs that are for other
things around work).

## Mail.app

I use the Gmail web interface for personal mail when I'm on my laptop, but when
I need a standalone app (for work, sometimes needing to be Exchange-enabled, or
when I'm on a mobile device), I reach for Mail.app. I dislike Mail.app's
keyboard shortcuts less than every other app I have tried.
