## Projects:

- [frameless.ahfr.org](http://frameless.ahfr.org/):
  Fun demo site from May-June 2015. Core concept: two different ways of describing who I am.
  Has a few bells, whistles, a "drag handle."
- [m.ahfr.org](http://m.ahfr.org):
  Project formerly known as 'Medium' - collection of quotes and links
  with a few original pieces content. Changed name after Medium.com became a thing. Rudimentary Vim keybindings.
- [forum](https://github.com/twinlabs/forum):
  Websockets + Node software that I wrote to replace our very-old phpBB.
  Used in a production environment since December 2014.
- [Adventures in Writing CSS](http://css.ahfr.org/):
  A collection of short articles on interesting topics in CSS.
- [Building Better UIs](http://css.ahfr.org/slides-better-uis.md):
  A talk (link goes to slides) on some strategies to improve the way you build UIs.
- [Just The Comments](http://comments.ahfr.org/):
  Ridiculous trashy fun app built during JSConf 2015 to filter comments on YouTube videos.
  _Yes, it initializes with a video of Fetty Wap and a filter
   that searches for comments about his eye._
- [gridify](https://github.com/nchase/gridify):
  utility primarily consumed as a bookmarklet (but can be used anywhere there's JS+DOM).
  adds a variable-sized grid overlay to a webpage. build pipeline is babel + browserify.
  Inspired by [Sassline](https://sassline.com/).
