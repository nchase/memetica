# Steel Cut Oats[^1]

* 6oz rice (1 "cup") -> 15 oz water.
* so, one mason jar glass at the 12 oz line (under the low rim) should get two-and-a-half mason jar glasses of water.
* seems like there's a little too much water, might be able to get away with "one glass rice = 2 glasses water".
* use "porridge" setting
